"""Constants for the HA-MCP custom component.

The integration serves two config-entry types under one domain
(:data:`DOMAIN`), discriminated by ``entry.data[CONF_ENTRY_TYPE]``:

* ``tools`` — the privileged file / YAML services (the original component).
  Pre-existing entries carry no ``entry_type`` key, so a missing value is
  treated as ``tools`` (no migration needed).
* ``server`` — the in-process ha-mcp FastMCP server (issue #1527), exposed
  through a Home Assistant webhook.

The two halves keep their constants in separate blocks below; the ``server``
block was folded in from the former standalone ``ha_mcp_server`` integration.

# allowlist, not an absolute guarantee: an admin who adds "blueprints" as a
# custom extra directory (issue #1567, see _current_extra_dirs) grants it
# read+write, since extra_dirs are honored on the write path too. Blueprint
# writes should instead go through ha_import_blueprint (which invokes the

# write, list, and delete, so neither a stored entry nor an in-flight one can
# punch through it.
#
# .storage holds HA's auth database (refresh/access tokens), hashed passwords,
# and every integration's cleartext credentials (core.config_entries,

#
# The component runs inside HA Core, so a volume is reachable only if the HA
# Core container actually mounts it (the standard HAOS/Supervised mounts are
# config/share/media/ssl/backup). An unmounted or non-existent root simply
# yields a "not found" at use time — adding it is harmless. As with the

# The operator-configurable extra-key list (ha-mcp's "extra YAML write

# is what keeps that setting from reaching HA's own trust boundary. It is
# checked before every single-key allowlist branch and is deliberately NOT
# operator-extendable – otherwise the same trust question just reopens
# one level up. Scope note: it guards the per-key merge path only.
# ``action="replace_file"`` returns before key validation runs at all, so a
# whole-file rewrite of configuration.yaml can still contain these keys –
# pre-existing behaviour, and the reason this is a floor under the extra-key
# setting rather than a general "these keys are unwritable" guarantee.
#
# The bar is not "powerful": command_line, shell_command and rest are
# already allowed above, so command execution and outbound HTTP are
# accepted surface. The bar is "redefines authentication, escalates the
# write surface itself, or can lock the user out" – unrecoverable in a
# way a broken sensor is not. Verified against home-assistant/core:
#   homeassistant: CORE_CONFIG_SCHEMA (homeassistant/core_config.py) takes
#     auth_providers / auth_mfa_modules (how the instance authenticates)
#     and packages (which folder is loaded as packages – a write here
#     would redirect the very surface this feature is bounded by).
#   http: takes trusted_proxies + use_x_forwarded_for (a spoofable
#     X-Forwarded-For becomes an auth bypass), cors_allowed_origins, and
#     ip_ban_enabled / login_attempts_threshold (brute-force protection).
#   frontend: takes extra_module_url, JavaScript modules loaded into the
#     authenticated dashboard – a stored-XSS foothold with access to the
#     instance and its tokens.
#   lovelace: takes resources (url + type: module), loaded whenever
#     resource_mode resolves to yaml. That is the same JS-into-an-
#     authenticated-dashboard primitive as frontend: extra_module_url, so
#     denying one while allowing the other would be a floor contradicting
#     its own rationale. Only the bare key is denied; the validated
#     lovelace.dashboards.<url_path> shape is a different branch and stays

# — see ``UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL`` and
# ``EmbeddedServerManager._async_ensure_package``). Both wheels contain the

ISSUE_START_FAILED = "server_start_failed"
# Repair issue surfaced when the installed ha-mcp server requires a newer
# custom component than the one running. The server package updates
# independently of the HACS component, so the running component can lag what
# the server expects; this points the user at the HACS component update
# (non-blocking).
ISSUE_COMPONENT_OUTDATED = "component_outdated"
# Repair issue surfaced while an automatic server update is HELD because the
# newer server release also shipped a newer custom component than the one
# running (issues #1783/#1785): installing that server under the old component
# is the combination that broke starts. Held is loud (this issue + a warning
# log every check) and escapable — applying the HACS component update (which
# takes an HA restart) unblocks the next check, and the update entity's
# Install button bypasses the hold entirely.
ISSUE_UPDATE_HELD = "server_update_held"
# Repair issue surfaced when HACS is tracking the MAIN ha-mcp server repo for
# this component (the pre-mirror install path — issue #1760). That install
# keeps working (HACS downloads the repo snapshot at the release tag, which
# contains the component), but HACS shows the SERVER's version numbers and
# release notes, not the component's own; HACS has no repository-migration
# mechanism, so this only self-resolves if the user re-adds the dedicated
# mirror (homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp-integration).

# nor unbind an HTTP view without a full Home Assistant restart, so both
# transitions need one; see oauth_legacy.bind_legacy_views.
