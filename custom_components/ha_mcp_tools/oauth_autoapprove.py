"""Unified scoped OAuth authorization endpoints (issue #1969).

In ``none`` webhook auth mode the secret webhook URL *is* the credential, so no
bearer is required and the forwarder always returns 200. But claude.ai's
connector onboarding intermittently front-loads OAuth discovery, and because the
component registers no ``/.well-known`` views in none mode, claude.ai falls
through to Home Assistant *core*'s own origin-root
``/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`` — which advertises
``client_id_metadata_document_supported`` but omits
``token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported: ["none"]`` and has no
``registration_endpoint``. claude.ai then can neither use CIMD nor do dynamic
client registration and shows "Automatic client registration isn't supported…".

This module owns three path-scoped ``OAUTH_BASE`` endpoints. In none mode the
authorize/token pair completes OAuth *invisibly* — no login, no consent — so a
connector that does run discovery resolves against our own corrected documents
(served by :mod:`mcp_webhook`) instead of HA core's broken root doc, and
connects with zero HA login:

* ``GET  {OAUTH_BASE}/authorize`` issues a PKCE-bound one-time code and
  immediately 302-redirects back to the client with ``?code=…&state=…`` — no
  page is rendered.
* ``POST {OAUTH_BASE}/token`` exchanges that code (public client, PKCE S256, no
  ``client_secret``) for an opaque access token. The token is *cosmetic* — none
  mode ignores bearers entirely — but is a real random string so a spec-strict
  client is satisfied.
* ``POST {OAUTH_BASE}/revoke`` fronts RFC 7009 revocation for ha_auth mode, the
  only mode that hands the client a signed refresh envelope core cannot redeem
  (#2248); it 404s in the other two.

The views dispatch per request from ``hass.data`` to the live legacy, ha_auth,
or none-mode provider (and 404 when no remote OAuth mode is live), mirroring the
discovery views so mode switches need no restart. The none-mode PKCE code store
and redirect-URI floor are reused from :mod:`oauth_legacy` rather than copied.

**Open-redirect policy.** In none mode THE SECRET WEBHOOK URL IS THE MAIN AND
ONLY FORM OF SECURITY. The OAuth surface exists purely for client compatibility;
its tokens grant nothing. ``/authorize`` therefore serves every provider and
302-redirects to any spec-valid ``redirect_uri``; malformed targets still hard
400 under :func:`oauth_legacy._is_valid_redirect_uri`. This makes the Home
Assistant origin usable as a crafted-link redirector, an accepted risk in the
secret-URL trust model. An exact-match callback allowlist shipped in PR #1976
in July 2026; it was retired on 2026-08-14 by maintainer decision to serve every
provider.
