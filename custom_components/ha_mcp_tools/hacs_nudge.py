"""Nudge HACS to refresh this component's repository info when a newer
component is detected (#1783/#1785 follow-up).

The component notices a newer custom component quickly — it checks PyPI every
6 hours (and on every reload/restart) and the auto-update gate reads the
component version shipped at each server release's tag. HACS, by contrast,
refreshes a *custom* repository's release data only about every 48 hours, so
the component update the hold (or the component-outdated repair) is waiting on
is usually not yet visible in HACS. This module runs the same force-refresh
that HACS's own repository "Update information" menu action performs, so HACS's
update entity flips promptly and Home Assistant advertises the component update
natively instead of the user waiting out HACS's cache.

HACS registers no service and ``homeassistant.update_entity`` is a no-op on its
entities, so there is no supported API for this: the refresh reaches directly
into HACS internals (``hass.data["hacs"]``). Those internals can change under us
at any HACS release, so EVERY access here is defensive and the whole interaction
is advisory — any failure degrades to a debug log and never touches the caller's
update-check path (which runs on bring-up, gating webhook registration, and on
the version coordinator's listener). The same unsupported ``hass.data["hacs"]``
reach as install_source_check, but deliberately logged at debug where that
module warns: this path retries on every 6h check, so a persistent HACS shape
change would otherwise warn forever about an advisory nicety.
