"""Detect a legacy (main-repo) HACS install source and warn (issue #1760).

Before the dedicated HACS mirror (``homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp-integration``)
existed, the README told users to add the MAIN ``ha-mcp`` server repository as
a HACS custom repository. Those installs still work — HACS downloads the repo
snapshot at the release tag, which contains this component — but HACS shows
the SERVER's version numbers (``the server's``) and the server/add-on release notes in
the update dialog, as if the component were the server itself. HACS has no
repository-migration mechanism, so this population stays confused forever
unless the component itself detects the legacy source and points them at the
mirror. The legacy install keeps working either way — this only files an
advisory repair issue, never blocks anything.
