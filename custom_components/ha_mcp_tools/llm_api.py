"""Expose the in-process server's toolset as a Home Assistant LLM API (#1745).

While the in-process server entry is up, the ha-mcp toolset is registered as
one or two LLM APIs (``homeassistant.helpers.llm``). Any Home Assistant
conversation agent — OpenAI, Google, Ollama, Anthropic, or any other — can
then select it in its "Control Home Assistant" option, and the user chats
with the toolset through the surfaces Home Assistant already has: the Assist
chat UI, the companion apps, and voice satellites. No separate chat frontend
is needed.

Two exposure modes (the ``llm_api_exposure`` entry option picks which are
registered; default is tool-search only):

* **tool search** — the agent gets a tiny catalog: the server's pinned tools
  mirrored directly, plus two meta-tools synthesized here: ``ha_search_tools``
  (find tools by task) and ``ha_call_tool`` (execute a discovered tool). This
  keeps per-turn context small — the shape context-limited models need.
* **full** — every exposed tool is mirrored directly into the agent's tool
  list, one schema each.

**Per-tool exposure is decided by the server, not here.** The server stamps
every ``tools/list`` entry with ``_meta.ha_mcp = {llm_api_exposed, pinned}``
(see ``src/ha_mcp/llm_exposure.py``): user toggles from the settings UI, with
deny-by-default for beta/developer/restart-reload-backup tools. Both modes
filter on the stamp, and the tool-search ``ha_call_tool`` forwarder re-checks
it at call time — a hidden tool is invisible (absent from lists and search
results) and a hallucinated call to one gets a plain unknown-tool error, the
same answer a nonexistent tool gets, so nothing leaks. Globally-disabled
tools never appear in ``tools/list`` at all and the server rejects calling
them by name, and every forwarded call traverses the server's policy /
read-only middleware exactly like any MCP client's call.

The server runs on its own worker thread behind a loopback HTTP listener, and
``ha_mcp`` must never be imported in the HA main process (see
:mod:`embedded_server`), so this module talks real MCP to the server over
loopback streamable HTTP. The ``mcp`` client SDK arrives with the
runtime-installed ha-mcp package (a fastmcp dependency), so every SDK import
here is lazy and the first one runs on the executor.

The tool list is fetched fresh on every ``async_get_api_instance`` call (once
per conversation turn): exposure toggles and runtime-registered custom tools
apply on the agent's next message, and two loopback round-trips per turn are
noise next to the LLM call itself. Tool calls likewise open a short-lived
stateless session each — the in-process server serves ``stateless_http=True``.

    same ``verify=False`` / ``trust_env=False`` posture as the canonical path

    too, so a real SSL context is pure waste and this call must never be
    diverted through an environment proxy (which would also leak the URL's
    embedded ``secret_path`` to it).

    ``timeout`` mirrors ``create_mcp_http_client`` (the factory this

    default on those older SDKs is this same flat ``httpx.Timeout(30.0)``,

    Builds a throwaway httpx client scoped to this one session rather than
    reusing Home Assistant's shared one (``helpers.httpx_client.
    get_async_client`` — the prior approach): the SDK applies NO timeout of
    its own when a caller-provided client is passed, so whatever timeout
    THAT client happens to carry becomes the real wire-level ceiling. HA's
    shared client is built with no explicit ``timeout=``, so it silently
    carries httpx's own hardcoded 5-second default — capping every tool call
    at 5 seconds of read-idle no matter how generous
    ``_CALL_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` / ``_LIST_TOOLS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` looked
    (live-found investigating a ~60s Assist-pipeline hang: a real tool doing
    real work never got anywhere near its own asyncio budget).

    ``verify=False`` is not a security relaxation: ``url`` is always
    ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>...`` (see ``async_register_llm_api``) — a
    plain-HTTP loopback call that never negotiates TLS — so building a real
    SSL context would be pure waste. It also keeps this loop-safe the same
    way the shared client did: an SSL context built with ``verify=True``
    loads the system CA bundle SYNCHRONOUSLY (live-found — HA's
    blocking-call monitor flagged this exact line when the SDK built its own
    default client), and skipping verification skips that load entirely.

    ``trust_env=False`` for the same "this is loopback, not the network"
    reason: httpx defaults to reading ``HTTP_PROXY``/``NO_PROXY`` from the
    environment, and ``127.0.0.1`` is not exempt unless ``NO_PROXY``
    explicitly lists it. Under an ``HTTP_PROXY`` that doesn't, this call
    would leave the loopback listener entirely and go out through the
    configured proxy instead — which also hands the proxy ``url``'s
    embedded ``secret_path`` (the private endpoint credential). Disabling
    env trust removes both failure modes; nothing here should ever consult
    a proxy.
