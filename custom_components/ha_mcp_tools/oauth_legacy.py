"""Legacy OAuth 2.1 authorization server for the HA-MCP Server webhook.

Ported from the webhook-proxy add-on's ``mcp_proxy/oauth.py`` ``OAuthProvider``
+ ``AuthorizeView`` + ``TokenView`` (the proven ``legacy`` mode). Self-hosted,
single-tenant authorization server with a static client_id/client_secret pair,
for MCP clients that need a credential to paste rather than HA core's native
OAuth (``ha_auth``). Written for Google Gemini Spark, whose custom connected
apps use the Client ID Metadata Document pattern that HA core's
``/auth/authorize`` did not support for cross-origin redirect_uris before
2026.9 (home-assistant/core#176282, fixed by #176286); ``ha_auth`` validates
CIMD itself since 2.0.0, so this is now the pasted-credential fallback.

Unlike the add-on, this module holds no reference to ``hass``, the webhook id,
or a public base URL: the discovery-document layer (RFC 8414 / RFC 9728) and
base-URL resolution already live in ``mcp_webhook.py``, shared with the
``ha_auth`` mode, and are extended there to be mode-aware. This module owns
only the OAuth-specific state (tokens, PKCE codes, client auth) and the two
root views the add-on's ``ha_auth`` mode never needed (``ha_auth`` mode has HA
core serve its own ``/auth/authorize`` + ``/auth/token``).

Tokens are opaque, HMAC-SHA256 signed (``body.sig``), and carry enough state
(``{kind, iat, exp, jti, cid}``) to validate without a server-side store, so
the integration survives HA restarts. ``cid`` (the client_id at issuance time)
means rotating the client_id revokes every outstanding token at the restart
that rebinds the root views with the new identity — until then the bound
provider keeps the old client_id and old tokens keep validating (see
:func:`bind_legacy_views`).
