"""ha_auth-mode OAuth indirection: component-owned endpoints in front of core.

Home Assistant core remains the authorization server — the user signs in on
core's own ``/auth/authorize`` page exactly as before. What changes is what the
CLIENT learns and calls: the unified ``{OAUTH_BASE}/authorize`` redirects the
browser into core, and ``{OAUTH_BASE}/token`` forwards the exchange
server-side. Two problems this kills:

* **Cached-endpoint stickiness.** A client that cached our advertised
  endpoints keeps reaching component-owned routes after an auth-mode switch,
  because those routes dispatch per request — it can no longer end up wedged
  on core's ``/auth/*`` (the un-retractable cache this replaces). A switch to a
  mode with different credentials can still require the client to re-authorize.
* **Cross-origin CIMD clients.** Core advertises CIMD but, before 2026.9
  (core issue #176282, fixed by #176286), never fetched the document, so
  clients whose redirect is not same-origin with their URL client_id died
  with "Invalid redirect URI". We validate the
  document HERE — the AS-side MUSTs from MCP 2026-07-28 client-registration —
  and hand core a translated client_id shaped to pass its long-stable
  same-origin IndieAuth rule.

REFRESH IDENTITY (issue #2248): core binds the refresh token to whatever
client_id the code leg presented, and a redirect_uri-less refresh grant carries
nothing that re-derives it — a loopback callback's runtime origin embeds an
ephemeral port (RFC 8252 §7.3), and a multi-origin registration is ambiguous.
So the identity is RECORDED at mint time instead of guessed later: every
server-side-forwarded 200 has its ``refresh_token`` replaced by a signed
envelope (:func:`wrap_refresh_token`) carrying core's real token plus the
client_id core bound it to, and the refresh leg unwraps it back into the exact
pair. :func:`translated_client_id_for_refresh` remains for tokens minted before
the envelope existed. The client therefore holds a value core cannot recognise,
and core answers a revocation 200 either way, so ``{OAUTH_BASE}/revoke`` fronts
revocation as well and unwraps before forwarding.

SECURITY: translation grants nothing new. Core already accepts any
self-asserted ``client_id == redirect-origin`` pair (that is how claude.ai
connects today), so rewriting a VALIDATED cross-origin identity into that shape
authorizes nothing a client could not already claim by presenting the
redirect-origin as its client_id directly. Anything that fails validation is
forwarded UNCHANGED and core's own checks apply. The CIMD fetch itself is the
only outbound request: https-only, no redirects, 10 KiB cap, 5 s timeout, and
DNS pinned to pre-validated globally routable addresses (SSRF floor per the MCP
security considerations page).

MIRROR: ``homeassistant-addon-webhook-proxy-dev/mcp_proxy_dev/oauth_indirect.py``
is the near-verbatim twin of this module. Keep behavioural changes on the two
sides in step; that file's header names the pair's one intended delta (the
loopback, redirect-shape, and base64url helpers come from ``oauth_legacy.py``
here and ``oauth.py`` there).
