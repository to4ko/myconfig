"""Run the ha-mcp FastMCP server in-process inside Home Assistant (issue #1527).

The :class:`EmbeddedServerManager` owns the full lifecycle of the in-process
ha-mcp server:

* ensures the ``ha-mcp`` package is importable (runtime pip install via
  Home Assistant's requirements manager, honoring an options-flow pip-spec
  override for pre-release testing, and forcing a real reinstall when that spec
  changes),
* provisions a long-lived Home Assistant admin token the server uses to reach HA
  core over loopback (REST + WebSocket),
* runs the server on a dedicated thread with its own asyncio loop — uvicorn
  skips signal capture off the main thread and a heavy tool can never stall HA's
  event loop — and
* tears the thread down cleanly, and revokes the provisioned credentials when
  the entry is removed.

Everything the server needs from ha-mcp is imported **inside the worker thread**,
after the required non-secret environment variables are staged, so importing this
module never pulls in ``ha_mcp`` (which may not be installed yet) and never runs
before the connection is in place. The loopback URL and the admin token are handed
to ha-mcp **in memory** via ``ha_mcp.config.set_embedded_connection`` — never
through ``os.environ`` — so the admin token can never be read from the shared HA
process environment. ``ha_mcp`` module-level imports are therefore forbidden here.

        Returns the installed version that the worker is about to run, for the
        caller's warm-cache purge decision.

        ``defer_mutations=True`` (a previous bring-up's worker is still
        importing) downgrades any would-be uninstall/force-install to the
        non-mutating fast path: replacing the distribution's files on disk
        under a live importer corrupts it the same way a sys.modules purge
        does. The deferred update applies on the next reload or HA restart.

        With auto-update on (the default) both channels install their
        distribution UNPINNED, so every entry reload / HA restart must pick up
        the newest build. Such a spec ALWAYS takes the force-install path
        (``--upgrade-package <dist>``, bypassing the requirements manager's
        is-installed shortcut) — that is what makes the channel auto-update,
        and scoping the upgrade to our own distribution is what keeps it
        from replacing packages Home Assistant ships (#2135/#2146). This runs in a
        background task, so it never blocks HA startup, and uv no-ops quickly
        when the newest build is already installed.

        Fast path: reserved for a stable INDEX spec — an explicit pip-spec
        override that is a version pin, or a channel with auto-update turned OFF
        (which pins to the installed version, see :meth:`_resolve_pip_spec`).
        When that spec matches the one last installed and the package imports,
        delegate the "already satisfied?" decision to Home Assistant's
        requirements manager; a pinned spec does not move, so there is nothing to
        upgrade to. A URL override (a tarball or ``file://`` wheel) is
        deliberately EXCLUDED: HA's is-installed check cannot verify a URL
        requirement, so delegating one always reaches its bare ``--upgrade``
        install — see the comment on ``spec_is_stable`` below. A CHANGED spec (a new override, a cleared override, a
        toggled auto-update, a channel switch) falls through to the
        force-install path below — and additionally uninstalls the replaced
        distribution first (:meth:`_async_remove_replaced_source`), because
        the upgrade flag alone decides by version and a changed SOURCE can
        keep the version string (issue #1914).

        On a channel switch the other channel's distribution is uninstalled first
        (:meth:`_async_remove_conflicting_dist`): ``ha-mcp`` and ``ha-mcp-dev``
        share the ``ha_mcp`` import package, so leaving both installed would make a
        pinned reinstall a no-op (breaking a dev→stable downgrade) and the reported
        version ambiguous.

        A one-shot pending-install marker (:data:`DATA_PENDING_INSTALL_VERSION`,
        set by the update entity's Install button — issue #1760) overrides both
        the unpinned-channel and auto-update-off pinning above for this single
        install, regardless of the ``auto_update`` option.

        Never imports ``ha_mcp`` in this (main) process — that happens only inside

        differs from the one about to be installed, the distribution the new

        first — the install that follows is then unconditionally real.

        every restart), when the new spec is a direct URL (always installs
        for real), when the named distribution is not installed (e.g. a
        cross-channel switch already removed it), when the stored spec is
        an index requirement on the SAME distribution (a repin — e.g.
        toggling auto-update rewrites bare ``ha-mcp`` to ``ha-mcp==X`` —
        draws from the same index either way, so version resolution is
        faithful and uninstalling a healthy install on a preference toggle
        would only add an offline-breakage window), or when the new spec is
        an exact pin on a version provably different from the installed one
        (the install cannot no-op, so the working build stays in place as
        the fallback if it fails).

        Unlike the other pre-install uninstalls this one is NOT best-effort:
        if the distribution survives a failed uninstall, the forced install
        would no-op as "already satisfied", the new spec would be persisted,

    On Python 3.14 with ``homeassistant`` installed as a setuptools *editable*
    package (the official HA container image), ``PathFinder.invalidate_caches()``
    raises ``KeyError`` at its ``del sys.path_importer_cache[name]`` line: the
    synthetic ``__editable__.<dist>.finder.__path_hook__`` placeholder is not an
    absolute path, so CPython takes the ``del`` branch on a key an earlier
    iteration already removed — a CPython 3.14 bug (the ``del`` should be a
    ``pop``). That aborts ``importlib.invalidate_caches()`` partway and, before
    this guard, crashed in-process server bring-up on every boot (issues #1891,
    #1985).

    On that ``KeyError`` we do CPython's own cleanup ourselves — prune the dead /
    relative ``sys.path_importer_cache`` entries with ``pop`` instead of the
    buggy ``del`` (the stale placeholder that trips the sweep is among them) —
    then re-run ``importlib.invalidate_caches()``. With the offending entries
    gone the retry completes CPython's full sweep itself: every live path-entry
    finder invalidated, the namespace-path epoch advanced, and the metadata
    finder refreshed. Delegating the second pass keeps us off private internals
    (no ``_NamespacePath`` / ``_path_isabs`` poking) and faithful to whatever the
    running Python's ``invalidate_caches`` does. Recovery only ever runs on the
    broken 3.14 path (the top-level call succeeds everywhere else); every
    non-``KeyError`` still propagates.

    The retry is itself guarded: a concurrent import on another HA-core thread
    could re-add a stale placeholder in the window between the prune and the
    retry, so a *second* ``KeyError`` is tolerated (logged, best-effort) rather
    than re-raised — a partial cache refresh must never re-crash bring-up, which

    * A URL requirement must be REINSTALLED. Measured on uv 0.11.33 (the
      version CI pins), re-running an unchanged ``name @ file://…`` spec
      reports "Checked 1 package" under both no flag and
      ``--upgrade-package`` — it installs nothing — while
      ``--reinstall-package`` replaces it. Auditing-and-skipping would keep
      the OLD code running while the bring-up logs success (the #1914

      guarantee that ``_replaced_dist_name`` and
      ``_async_remove_replaced_source`` skip their uninstall on.
    * An index requirement only needs an UPGRADE, scoped to the
      distribution the spec itself names. Force-reinstalling one instead
      would reopen the non-atomic uninstall-then-extract window this PR
      exists to close, on every bring-up, for a spec that never needed it.

    A bare URL names no distribution of its own, and the channel's dist is
    the wrong guess: a repository tarball installs as ``ha-mcp`` whatever
    channel is selected (see :meth:`_replaced_dist_name`), so on the dev
    channel scoping to ``ha-mcp-dev`` would name a package the URL does not
    provide — uv would report success while leaving the real ``ha-mcp``
    un-refreshed, and a mutable URL (a branch tarball, a rebuilt artifact)
    keeps its version string, so nothing else would catch it. Both known
    dists are therefore named: reinstalling one that is not installed is a
    harmless no-op for uv (verified: exit 0, package still installed from
