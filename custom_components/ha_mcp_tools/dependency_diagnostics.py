"""Name the dependency conflict behind an embedded-server import failure (issue #2239).

Home Assistant enforces every custom integration's ``manifest.json``
``requirements`` at every startup, in one shared site-packages tree. A third
party integration that pins a package this component's server also depends on
therefore *downgrades that package for us*, silently, on a schedule we do not
control — and the resulting failure surfaces far from its cause. The reported
incident: an integration pinning ``mcp==1.14.1`` dropped the shared ``mcp``
below fastmcp's ``>=1.24.0`` floor, fastmcp's resource module failed on
``from mcp.types import Icon``, and fastmcp re-raised that as the generic hint
"FastMCP server support is not installed" — which names neither the package,
nor the version, nor the integration that moved it.

This module turns that class of failure into a sentence a user can act on. It
is deliberately three independent, side-effect-free steps, so each can be
tested (and reused) on its own:

* :func:`root_import_failure` digs the real error out of an exception chain
  whose outermost message is a misleading fallback,
* :func:`audit_dependency_graph` walks the installed requirement graph from a
  root distribution and reports every requirement the installed tree does not
  satisfy,
* :func:`find_pinning_integrations` scans ``custom_components/*/manifest.json``
  for the integration whose pin caused it, and
* :func:`describe_dependency_failure` composes the three into one message.

Nothing here imports Home Assistant, or any other module of this component: the
diagnosis has to run in exactly the situation where the dependency tree is
already broken, so it may depend only on the standard library and ``packaging``
(a Home Assistant runtime dependency, always importable). Every function is
total — malformed metadata, unreadable files and unparseable version strings
produce a smaller answer, never an exception, because a diagnostic that raises
inside an error handler replaces the failure it was meant to explain.

    which is the question a resolver never gets asked again once Home Assistant
    has reinstalled a pin behind its back.

    ``search_path`` is the metadata search path (``None`` = the default
    ``sys.path`` behavior); it exists so tests can point at a synthetic tree.
    The distribution map is built once, so the walk costs one metadata scan

    Extras are tracked per edge: a requirement scoped ``extra == "server"``
    applies only on a path that pulled its distribution in as ``dist[server]``,

    alone. That both terminates cycles and keeps a diamond from being judged
    under the wrong extra set. Requirements are still *checked* under every
    extra set that reaches them, so equal violations found twice are collapsed.

    A missing distribution is reported and not recursed into (it declares
